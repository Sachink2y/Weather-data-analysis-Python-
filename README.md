# Weather-data-analysis-Python-
## Overview
This project explores weather data using Python to derive insights, perform data exploratory analysis (DEA), and answer advanced questions.

## Objectives
1. Perform comprehensive Data Exploratory Analysis (DEA).
2. Analyze instances of Snow and Rain weather conditions.
3. Investigate extreme weather conditions using advanced filters.
4. Visualize distributions of Wind Speed and Visibility for different weather conditions.
5. Derive statistical summaries for Weather Conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Missingno

## Key Insights
- Snow and Rain conditions occur frequently and are grouped by severity.
- Visibility and Pressure play crucial roles in understanding extreme weather events.
- Wind Speed and Visibility show significant differences in Clear and Rainy weather.
